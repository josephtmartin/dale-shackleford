        I am a young audio engineer and producer originally from Oklahoma, but am currently based in
        the Nashville, TN area. I am finishing my Bachelor's degree in Audio Production and
        beginning a Masters of Fine Arts in Recording Arts and Technology at Middle Tennessee State
        University. I have a deep passion for pushing faders and making music, especially in studio
        settings. I also work as a songwriter and artist and have been writing for 6-7 years. I
        believe hard work, dedication, and letting the music tell its own story is the best way to
        make great music happen.

        I am proficient in Pro Tools and have experience on large format consoles, including the
        API Vision and the SSL Duality. I have tracked bands on both boards, as well as mixed on the
        Vision, various smaller SSL consoles, and in the box. My focus is in tracking live
        recording instruments and mixing to let the realness of those tracks shine for themselves.
        My genre experience in recording includes Rock, Pop-Rock, Country, and Folk.
