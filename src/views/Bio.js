      <p className='bio-para'>
      Growing up in Oklahoma, Dale was involved in music from a young age. From singing at church to traveling across Oklahoma with his family sharing stories and singing in Chickasaw, Shack loved all things music.
      However, he never expected to create a career in the industry. At the age of 15 he wrote his first songs with his sister after she grew tired of singing the only song he knew how to play.
      The first day they wrote two songs together and it sparked a passion for creating original content. He continued writing for the next few years and attended Eastern Oklahoma State College to study music.
      At this point he also found a new related passion in music production. He then took a big leap and transferred to Middle Tennessee State University where he earned a Bachelor’s degree in Audio Production and
      continued on for a Master’s of Fine Arts in Recording Arts and Technology. During this time, Dale had the opportunity to learn and grow as an audio engineer and music producer outside Music City working with other people’s songs,
      helping them bring their dreams to life.
